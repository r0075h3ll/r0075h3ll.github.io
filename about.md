Greetings! This is Hardik Nanda, and I possess a strong interest in Web Application Security, Offensive Security and FOSS. I have done B.Sc. with Computer Science as major, and I spend most of time tinkering with web applications and writing code to automate tasks.

At present, I am searching for a full time job/internship that will allow me to utilize my knowledge and abilities in a corporate setting while also gaining valuable practical experience. If given the opportunity, I would bring a highly motivated, curious, and intellectually driven mindset to the table, demonstrating a strong desire to learn and grow.<br>
