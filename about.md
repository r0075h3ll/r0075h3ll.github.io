Greetings! This is Hardik Nanda a.k.a. r0075h3ll, I'm a Computer Science graduate and I spend most of my time, these days, tinkering with Web Applications, Binaries & Mathematics.

At present, I am looking for a remote full time job/internship opportunity that will allow me to utilize my knowledge and abilities in a corporate setting while also gaining valuable practical experience. If given the opportunity, I would bring a highly motivated, curious, and intellectually driven mindset to the table, demonstrating a strong desire to learn and grow.<br>
